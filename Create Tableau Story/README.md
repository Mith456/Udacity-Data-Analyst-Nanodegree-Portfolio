## Summary

The Flight dataset was downloaded from RITA website containing information on ﬂight delays and performance.

Here is the link for the dataset: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp 

Here is the overview of what my tableau story displays in visualization.

1)What are percentage of different ﬂight delays, which contribute the most and ﬂight arrivals problems such as canceled/diverted,
these to be explored over different years, airports and carrier types?

2)Which airports contribute the most for delays when all carriers are taken into consideration 
and for a particular carrier, which airports cause most delays and also what type of delay is the major contributor? 

3)What are the carriers that causes most delays when all airports are considered?

4)What are the top10 airports and carriers contributing for most delays and their relationship?
